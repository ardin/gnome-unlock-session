# GNOME-unlock-session

## General notes

Are you tired continuously entering password when your home workstation is locked?

I am. 

Thus, this program unlock your workstation by pressing **SUPER+U** without additional credentials.

I don't recommend this in sensitive environments or where someone can apply "Mortal Combat" combination.
